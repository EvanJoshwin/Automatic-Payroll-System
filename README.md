# Automatic-Payroll-System
The main objective of this project is to create a Customer Communication Management Solution that will produce payslips automatically. Pay slip creation is currently a disjointed procedure that involves manual stages since it must consolidate data from numerous sources (employee, leaves, loans, benefits, rewards, incentives etc.). The existing manual procedure is incredibly ineffective and time-consuming, which results in an increase in the number of services calls for the firm's HR department. As a result, this project substitutes the current manual method with a solution to offer a seamless, effective, and affordable service for generation and delivery of the communication linked to the payslips.
